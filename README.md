# Network-Analysis
Assignment for the course [Social Network Analysis](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/dmst/content/social-network-analysis) in the 4th year winter semester:

Choose a network you wish to analyze, explain why you chose to analyze it and describe what you want to achieve through this analysis. Then provide a succinct analysis of the basic properties of the network:
* Graphical representation of the network
* Basic topological properties, such as numbers of nodes and edges, network
diameter, and average path length.
* Component measures, such as number of connected components, existence
of a giant component and component size distribution.
* Degree measures, such as maximum and average node degrees, as well as
degree distribution.
* Centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector)
* Clustering effects in the network: average clustering coefficient, number of
triangles, clustering coefficient distribution, existence of the triadic closure
phenomenon in the friendship neighborhood.
* Bridges and local bridges.
* Gender and homophily.
* Communities

The analysis concerns a London-based inner-city street gang. All the information about the dataset can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/datasets/covert-networks/londongang). In detail:
* [GANG NETWORK ANALYSIS.pdf](https://github.com/stef4k/Network-Analysis/blob/main/GANG%20NETWORK%20ANALYSIS.pdf) is the whole detailed analysis in pdf 
* [ANALYSIS_PYTHON.ipynb](https://github.com/stef4k/Network-Analysis/blob/main/ANALYSIS_PYTHON.ipynb) is the analysis of the gang network using networkX (python library) in a jupyter notebook.
